<!-- The only minor imposition Thymeleaf makes on the HTML file is the addition of the XML
namespace attribute and the use of Thymeleaf tag attributes. Fortunately, the
Thymeleaf tag attributes are relatively easy to use, and the syntax for pulling the
outcome variable out of the Spring MVC model class is just standard Spring Expression
Language and makes the learning curve small. After developers work with Thymeleaf,
they will soon prefer it to JSPs. -->
